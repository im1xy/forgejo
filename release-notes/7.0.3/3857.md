- [PR](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/3857): Gitea v1.22 is [not published yet](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30731) as of 21 May 2024 and in reality Forgejo v7.0.3 is compatible with Gitea v1.21.11. The Gitea v1.22 release was anticipated to happen shortly after [Forgejo v7.0 was published on 23 April 2024](https://forgejo.org/2024-04-release-v7-0/) because it was already in the late stages of its release candidate lifecycle. However, around 27 April, [the Gitea release candidates were dropped](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30731) and the release candidates restarted from the Gitea development branch.
